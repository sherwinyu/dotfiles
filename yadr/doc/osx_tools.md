## Recommended OSX Tools

 * NValt - Notational Velocity alternative fork - http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/ - syncs with SimpleNote
 * Vimium for Chrome - vim style browsing. The `f` to type the two char alias of any link is worth it.
 * QuickCursor - gives you Apple-Shift-E to edit any OSX text field in vim.
