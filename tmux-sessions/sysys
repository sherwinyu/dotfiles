# Arrived on after much experimentaiton
# This works: 
#
#      send-keys "cd ~/project/weave" Enter 
#
# But requires doing it for every window. 
# I wanted a solution that "propagates" for every window, ala how you would do it if you were actually creating the windows yourself
# So I looked into default-path.
# At first I tried using default-path "~/projects/weave" but it didn't like the ~ relative path.
# So instead we will use the $HOME variable

set-option -g default-path "$HOME/projects/sysys"
