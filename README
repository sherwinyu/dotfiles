### Note to self

These dotfiles are no longer maintained (though the repo has served you well in the last year!)

In July of 2021, you moved to trying to store dotfiles as a [bare repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). 

You probably want to be using https://github.com/sherwinyu/.cfg
